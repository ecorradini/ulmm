# Access redundancy κ — code and data

Reproduction package for *Access Redundancy and Single Points of Failure in Coupled
Demand–Access Networks: An Exact Max-Flow Resilience Measure and the Misranking of
Route-Diversity Indices*.

The access redundancy `κ(d)` of a demand `d` is the maximum number of edge-disjoint directed
paths from `d` to an access set on a friction-aware street substrate; by Menger's theorem it
equals the minimum number of substrate edges whose removal isolates `d` (the exact
targeted-attack budget), and its minimum cut names the responsible streets.

## Layout

```
code/      analysis scripts (Python; run from the repository root)
data/      zipped extracts (unzip in place before running — see Setup)
results/   per-demand result files behind every table and figure (CSV, ready to inspect)
```

## Data availability

The five street substrates (OSMnx, network type `drive_service`), the 500 m demand grids, and
the last-mile access inventories (OpenStreetMap `amenity=post_office|parcel_locker`; retail and
service POI tags as in Appendix B of the paper) were extracted in **September 2025**. The
independent New York City extract used in the discriminant-validity test was downloaded in
**October 2025**, and the healthcare access sets (`amenity=hospital|clinic|doctors`) in
**June 2026**. Population weights use the **WorldPop 2020 1 km UN-adjusted** rasters; the crash
and 311 records are **2024 NYC Open Data** exports.

| `data/` archive | Unzips to | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ulmm_pickles.zip` | `ulmm_pickles/` | the 5 city ULMM substrates + the 3 European healthcare variants + size summaries |
| `cache_nyc_ulmm.zip` | `cache_nyc_ulmm/` | the independent NYC extract (`graph_G`, `segments_fe`, anchors, demand weights) and the 2024 truck-crash / 311 record exports |
| `cache_pop.zip` | `cache_pop/` | the WorldPop 2020 1 km rasters (NLD, ESP, FRA, USA) |

The Seattle and New York City healthcare access sets are queried live from OpenStreetMap by
`kappa_healthcare.py` (no fixed snapshot); the three European healthcare substrates are shipped
as cached ULMM pickles built by `build_healthcare.py`.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt        # Python 3.12; OSMnx pulls in GeoPandas/Shapely/Rasterio
cd <repo root>
unzip -o data/ulmm_pickles.zip         # -> ulmm_pickles/
unzip -o data/cache_nyc_ulmm.zip       # -> cache_nyc_ulmm/
unzip -o data/cache_pop.zip            # -> cache_pop/
```

All scripts use paths relative to the repository root, so **run them from the root**, e.g.
`python code/reanchor_kappa.py`. Each writes its outputs to `results/`; the figure scripts write
PNGs to `../paper/` (edit the output path, or create a sibling `paper/` directory, for a
standalone run). A small per-process cache is created under `cache/` on first run.

## Pipeline

`ablations.py` is the shared library (`load_ulmm`, `collapsed_graph`, the κ max-flow machinery);
`build_ulmm_mod.py` / `build_healthcare.py` are the substrate builders. The result CSVs in
`results/` already reproduce every number in the paper; to regenerate them, run:

1. `reanchor_kappa.py` — primary multi-entry κ, both orientations, k∈{1,3}; cut location.
   → `results/reanchor_{perdemand,summary}.csv` (**Tables 4, 6**; timings for **Table 2**).
   The k=1 slice provides the single-entry labels used downstream (`kappa.py` recomputes the
   same single-entry κ independently as `results/kappa_perdemand.csv`).
2. `kappa_ksweep.py` — anchoring-granularity sweep k∈{1..5}+250 m (**Table 7**).
3. `misranking2.py` — diversity indices vs κ, single-entry config (**Table 5**, left).
4. `misranking_multientry.py` — same, multi-entry config (**Table 5**, right); reuses
   `misranking2.py` and `results/reanchor_perdemand.csv`.
5. `k_sensitivity.py` — edge-dissimilarity AUC vs route budget K (§ Misranking).
6. `cut_chars.py` — cut-location and entry-set diameters (§ Robustness).
7. `kappa_nodedisjoint.py` — node- vs edge-disjoint κ (§ Robustness).
8. `kappa_physical.py` — physical-segment (way-disjoint) bracket (§ Robustness, Prop. on
   antiparallel arcs).
9. `kappa_popweight.py` — population-weighted (α_pop=1) sensitivity (§ Robustness).
   `e6_robust.py` — illustration that κ is byte-identical across friction salience
   λ∈{0.5,1,2} (the invariance check cited in § Robustness).
10. `density_curve.py` — access-density sweep (**Figure 3**).
11. `cutcrit_external.py` (+ `b1_wd_external.py`) — held-out NYC discriminant-validity test
    (**Table 8**).
12. `kappa_healthcare.py` (+ `pop_weights.py`) — population-weighted healthcare instantiation
    (**Table 9**).
13. `fig_kappa.py`, `fig_spof_map.py` — **Figures 2 and 4**.
14. `toy_check.py` — end-to-end correctness assertions on synthetic networks.

κ is invariant to the cost model, so it does not depend on the friction parameters; those enter
only the route-diversity baselines (van profile).
